# CLASP-CEPR Turnover Calculator

Turnover is costly. Despite the harm it can cause to the bottom line, many businesses do not actually know how much turnover costs them. Policies that support workers, such as paid sick days, a fair minimum 
wage, investments in workforce training, and work sharing, can help decrease turnover and reduce these costs. This turnover calculator provides an estimate of how much turnover costs your organization.

Please note that these questions are best directed to human resources professionals or to business owners who handle their own staffing. Costs may vary for different types of employees. The turnover calculator allows you to vary wages, weekly hours, and recruiting and hiring costs to calculate the cost of turnover for different categories of workers.
